## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: All Requested Changes

### (0) ‚ùå Removed reject functionality (not part of specs)
- Removed `TICTACTOE_ACCEPT` and `TICTACTOE_DECLINE` message types
- Removed `handle_tictactoe_accept()` and `handle_tictactoe_decline()` methods
- Removed `accept_game_invitation()` and `decline_game_invitation()` methods
- Removed pending invitations system
- Games now auto-accept immediately upon invitation

### (1) ‚úÖ Extended GAME command with symbol choice and first move
- **Symbol Assignment:** Inviter can now choose X or O
- **First Move:** If choosing X, can make first move in same command

### (2) ‚úÖ Fixed GAMEID format to gX (X = 0-255)
- Changed from `game_{random_hex}` to `g{counter}`
- Added `game_counter` that cycles 0-255
- Format: `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, ..., `g255`, then wraps back to `g0`

## üéÆ New GAME Command Formats

```bash
GAME                      # Show help and active games
GAME <user@ip>            # Invite user (you are X, default)
GAME <user@ip> O          # Invite user (you are O, they are X)
GAME <user@ip> X <pos>    # Invite and make first move at position
GAME <game_id> <pos>      # Make a move in existing game
GAME LIST                 # Show active games with boards
```

## üìã Examples

### Invite as X (default):
```
GAME alice@192.168.1.100
```
‚Üí You are X, Alice is O, you play first

### Invite as O:
```
GAME alice@192.168.1.100 O
```
‚Üí You are O, Alice is X, Alice plays first

### Invite and make first move:
```
GAME alice@192.168.1.100 X 5
```
‚Üí You are X, make first move at center (position 5)

### Make a move:
```
GAME g0 3
```
‚Üí Play at position 3 in game g0

## üîß Technical Implementation

1. **TICTACTOE_INVITE** - Enhanced with `INVITER_SYMBOL` and `BOARD` fields
2. **TICTACTOE_MOVE** - Unchanged
3. **TICTACTOE_RESULT** - Unchanged

### Key Changes in `message_handler.py`:
- `send_tictactoe_invite(target_user_id, chosen_symbol='X', first_move_position=None)`
- `_generate_game_id()` - Returns `g{counter}` format
- `handle_tictactoe_invite()` - Handles symbol assignment and board state

## üéØ Game Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Alice invites Bob as X
```
Alice: GAME bob@192.168.1.100
‚Üí Alice=X, Bob=O, Alice plays first, Game ID=g0
```

### Scenario 2: Alice invites Bob as O
```
Alice: GAME bob@192.168.1.100 O
‚Üí Alice=O, Bob=X, Bob plays first, Game ID=g1
```

### Scenario 3: Alice invites and plays first move
```
Alice: GAME bob@192.168.1.100 X 5
‚Üí Alice=X, Bob=O, Alice already played at center, Bob's turn, Game ID=g2
```

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Case Sensitivity Bug:** Fixed with `original_cmd` preservation
2. **Game ID Format:** Now follows `gX` specification (0-255)
3. **Symbol Assignment:** Inviter can choose X or O
4. **First Move:** Can be made during invitation
5. **Auto-Accept:** Games start immediately without manual acceptance

## üöÄ Ready for Testing

The enhanced implementation is complete and ready for multi-peer testing!

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Terminal 1
python run_peer.py
# Username: alice

# Terminal 2  
python run_peer.py
# Username: bob

# Alice invites Bob and plays first move
GAME bob@<ip> X 5

# Bob sees invitation and board, makes move
GAME g0 1

# Continue playing...
```
