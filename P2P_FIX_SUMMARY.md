# P2P System - Error Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Socket Connection Reset Errors (WinError 10054)
**Problem**: UDP sockets on Windows were throwing "connection forcibly closed" errors
**Solution**: 
- Added proper error handling for ConnectionResetError and OSError 10054
- Added socket timeouts to prevent indefinite blocking
- Added Windows-specific SIO_UDP_CONNRESET socket option to disable connection reset errors
- Added SO_REUSEADDR to allow multiple instances

### 2. Port Binding Conflicts
**Problem**: Discovery port 50999 was conflicting with other applications
**Solution**:
- Changed discovery port to 51000
- Added fallback port binding that tries multiple ports
- Added proper error handling for port binding failures

### 3. Discovery Timing Issues
**Problem**: Discovery intervals were too long (30 seconds)
**Solution**:
- Reduced discovery interval to 5 seconds for faster peer discovery
- Reduced peer timeout to 60 seconds for testing

### 4. Input Handling Issues
**Problem**: EOFError when piping input to the application
**Solution**:
- Added proper EOFError handling in user input
- Added default values for username and verbose mode
- Improved error handling in command loop

### 5. Excessive Debug Logging
**Problem**: Too many debug messages cluttering the console output
**Solution**:
- Removed excessive discovery broadcast logs
- Removed "ignoring own discovery message" logs
- Made peer discovery messages only appear in verbose mode
- Cleaned up initialization messages

## Files Modified

1. **peer/config/settings.py**
   - Changed DISCOVERY_PORT from 50999 to 51000
   - Reduced DISCOVERY_INTERVAL from 30 to 5 seconds
   - Reduced PEER_TIMEOUT from 300 to 60 seconds
   - Added more broadcast addresses

2. **peer/network/network_manager.py**
   - Added Windows-specific socket error handling
   - Added socket timeouts and proper error recovery
   - Added SIO_UDP_CONNRESET socket option for Windows
   - Improved port binding with fallback options
   - Enhanced discovery broadcasting

3. **peer/discovery/peer_manager.py**
   - Added better debug logging for discovery process
   - Improved error handling in discovery loop
   - Added more verbose peer discovery messages

4. **peer/core/peer_core.py**
   - Added EOFError handling for input
   - Added default values for username and verbose mode
   - Improved error handling and logging

5. **peer/ui/user_interface.py**
   - Added missing imports (os, base64, mimetypes)
   - Improved command input handling
   - Added single-letter command shortcuts
   - Better error handling in command loop

## How to Test

### Single Instance Test
```bash
python run_peer.py
```
Enter username and verbose mode preference. You should see no socket errors.

### Multi-Instance Test (Peer Discovery)
1. Open two terminal windows
2. In first terminal:
   ```bash
   python run_peer.py
   ```
   Enter username like "Alice"

3. In second terminal:
   ```bash
   python run_peer.py
   ```
   Enter username like "Bob"

4. Wait a few seconds - the peers should discover each other
5. Use `LIST` command to see discovered peers
6. Use `POST` command to send broadcast messages
7. Use `DM` command to send direct messages

### Textual UI Test
```bash
run_textual_ui.bat
```
The textual UI should now work with real peer discovery.

## Verification

Run the verification script to confirm fixes:
```bash
python test_socket_fix.py
```

This should show "âœ… SOCKET ERRORS FIXED!" without any connection reset errors.

## Expected Behavior

- No more "WinError 10054: connection forcibly closed" errors
- Peers should discover each other within 5-10 seconds
- Commands should work without socket errors
- Multiple instances can run simultaneously
- Broadcast and direct messages should work between peers

## Commands Available

- `POST` or `P` - Send broadcast message to all peers
- `DM` or `D` - Send direct message to specific peer
- `PROFILE` or `PROF` - Update and broadcast user profile
- `LIST` or `L` - Show discovered peers
- `VERBOSE` or `V` - Toggle verbose mode
- `QUIT` or `Q` - Exit the application

The peer-to-peer system is now fully functional with proper error handling!
