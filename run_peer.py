Key Features:
- POST: Broadcast messages to all discovered peers
- DM: Send direct messages to specific peers  
- PROFILE: Share your profile (with optional avatar) with all peers
- LIST: Show all discovered peers on the network
- VERBOSE: Toggle between technical and user-friendly display
- QUIT: Exit the application

Peer Discovery:
- Peers automatically discover each other via UDP broadcast
- Uses port 50999 for discovery announcements
- Each peer listens on a random port (8000-9999)
- Peers are removed after 5 minutes of inactivity

Getting Started:
1. Start multiple instances of this script on the same network
2. Wait a few seconds for peer discovery to work
3. Use LIST command to see discovered peers
4. Start chatting with POST and DM commands!
