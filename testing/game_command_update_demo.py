print("=== Updated GAME Command Structure ===\n")

print("REMOVED:")
print("  ❌ GAME <user@ip>           - Invite user to play (you are X)")
print("     This command has been removed from the system.\n")

print("REMAINING COMMANDS:")
print("  ✅ GAME                      - Show help and active games")
print("  ✅ GAME <user@ip> O          - Invite user to play (you are O)")  
print("  ✅ GAME <user@ip> X <pos>    - Invite and make first move")
print("  ✅ GAME <game_id> <pos>      - Make a move (position 0-8)")
print("  ✅ GAME LIST                 - Show active games")

print("\n=== Usage Examples ===")
print("1. Invite someone to play (you are O):")
print("   GAME alice@192.168.1.100 O")
print("")
print("2. Invite and make first move as X:")
print("   GAME alice@192.168.1.100 X 4")
print("")
print("3. Make a move in existing game:")
print("   GAME g5 7")
print("")
print("4. List active games:")
print("   GAME LIST")

print("\n=== Rationale ===")
print("The simple GAME <user@ip> command was removed because:")
print("• It defaulted to X without explicit symbol choice")
print("• The remaining commands provide explicit symbol selection")
print("• This reduces ambiguity in game invitations")
print("• Users must now be intentional about their symbol choice")

print("\n=== Technical Changes ===")
print("Files modified:")
print("• peer/ui/user_interface.py")
print("  - Removed 2-parameter GAME command handling")
print("  - Updated help text in two locations")
print("  - Maintained all other functionality")

print("\nAll other game features remain unchanged:")
print("✓ Position numbering (0-8)")
print("✓ Colored board display (X=Red, O=Green)")
print("✓ Turn tracking and validation")
print("✓ Win/draw detection")
print("✓ Message format compliance")
