Summary of Bug Fixes Applied to Tic-Tac-Toe System

ISSUE 1: Network Error Spam when Player Quits
============================================
Problem: When a player quit, the remaining player saw repeated error messages:
"Error receiving message on main socket: [WinError 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host"

Solution Applied:
- Modified peer/network/network_manager.py
- Added specific handling for OSError with winerror 10054
- These errors are now silently ignored (continue statement)
- Other socket errors are still properly logged for debugging
- Applied to both _listen_main_socket() and _listen_discovery_socket()

Code Changes:
```python
# Before:
except Exception as e:
    if self.running:
        print(f"Error receiving message on main socket: {e}")

# After:
except OSError as e:
    if e.winerror == 10054:  # Connection forcibly closed
        continue  # Silently ignore
    elif self.running:
        print(f"Error receiving message on main socket: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    if self.running:
        print(f"Error receiving message on main socket: {e}")
```

ISSUE 2: Colored Board Display (X = Red, O = Green)
===================================================
Problem: The tic-tac-toe board displayed X and O in plain text without visual distinction.

Solution Applied:
- Modified peer/core/message_handler.py
- Added ANSI color codes for terminal display
- X displays in bold red: \033[1m\033[91mX\033[0m
- O displays in bold green: \033[1m\033[92mO\033[0m
- Position numbers remain uncolored for better visibility

Code Changes:
```python
# Added color constants:
class Colors:
    RED = '\033[91m'      # Red for X
    GREEN = '\033[92m'    # Green for O  
    RESET = '\033[0m'     # Reset to default color
    BOLD = '\033[1m'      # Bold text

# Updated _display_board() method:
def colorize_cell(cell):
    if cell == 'X':
        return f"{Colors.BOLD}{Colors.RED}X{Colors.RESET}"
    elif cell == 'O':
        return f"{Colors.BOLD}{Colors.GREEN}O{Colors.RESET}"
    else:
        return cell
```

COMPATIBILITY:
- Network fix: Windows-specific (WinError 10054)
- Color fix: Works on most modern terminals supporting ANSI escape codes

TESTING:
Both fixes have been tested and compile successfully. The system maintains all existing functionality while improving user experience.
